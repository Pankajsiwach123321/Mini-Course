                And we know firsthand that building a career as a software
                engineer without a computer science degree is possible. <br />{" "}
                We started where you are *right now*â€”without engineering
                degrees, a professional portfolio, or years of experience.{" "}
                <br /> Then we climbed the ranks to hold senior positions at
                tech titans like Amazon, Apple, and the US government. <br />{" "}
                Throughout our careers, weâ€™ve managed entire teams of engineers,
                directed $30 million program budgets, and built 2 successful
                tech startups (one that we sold). <br />
                Learning to code did more than add a few impressive lines to our
                resumes. It literally changed our livesâ€¦
